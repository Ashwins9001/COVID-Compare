Questions about access to supplies are emerging among other vulnerable populations as health officials and community leaders work to contain spread of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan’s far north.The region has seen a spike in cases in and around the remote Dene village of La Loche, because the last thing that people want is a few weeks from now (is) being told, ‘OK, we loosened the rules and now COVID’s spreading again and you’re all going to have go inside for the rest of the summer.”’The comments came less than 24 hours after Quebec’s public health institute said deaths could soar to 150 a day in the greater Montreal area if physical distancing measures are lifted. New cases could mushroom to 10,000 by June amid a potential surge in hospitalizations.Premier Francois Legault said this week that elementary schools, daycares and retail stores with outdoor entrances in Montreal can reopen May 25 — the second time he has pushed back the date, but ahead of other large cities.Federal officials remain concerned about a rising death toll.“I’m afraid of more people dying and more outbreaks,” said Dr. Howard Njoo, the country’s deputy chief public health officer.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]Long-term care residents account for more than 80 per cent of deaths caused by the virus across Canada despite making up only one in five cases, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said.Stricter measures “may have to be reinstated” if controls ease up too soon, she said.“The virus has not disappeared from the face of the earth,” Tam said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their collective work in this is critical and our commitment to support them in making sure they have what they need and are able to continue to protect their community members remains steadfast,” Miller said.He cited a need for better data collection to help protect the communities and understand the spread of the virus among Indigenous people, and called on provincial governments to help in that area.The full scope of the outbreak among Indigenous populations remains unknown because federal data collection is carried out mainly among on-reserve and northern communities, he said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are some things you need to know:Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate.Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.Get a roundup of the most important and intriguing stories, delivered to your inboxGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing stories," delivered to your inbox""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, MPs from all parties are vowing to turn over their pay boost to charities and non-profit organizations working to cushion the impact of the national health emergency.A spokeswoman for the prime minister said Trudeau will give his pay boost to non-profit organizations in his Montreal riding.Similarly, a spokeswoman for Scheer said the Regina-based Opposition leader intends to give his pay increase to “a local charity who is working hard to support Canadians affected by COVID-19.”Denise Siele added that it’s up to the government to introduce legislation to freeze parliamentary salaries “should they so choose.”NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh “makes donations to organizations and local causes throughout the year and, with the salary raise for MPs, he will increase his donations,” said his spokeswoman, Melanie Richer, adding that the same applies to New Democrat MPs.Various Conservative MPs have issued statements over the past week promising to donate their imminent pay boosts to charities.READ MORE: Coronavirus — Parliament may be recalled again to approve emergency wage subsidyGiven the current crisis, Alberta MP Blaine Calkins called the pay hike “not only untimely but, frankly, it’s in poor taste.”Conservatives have also been demanding that Trudeau cancel the planned increase in the federal carbon tax which kicks in today, raising the carbon price on fuel purchases to $30 per tonne from $20. That will mean drivers will pay roughly an extra two cents a litre at the gas pump.The tax applies in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Nunavut and Yukon, none of which have imposed their own price on carbon that meets the federal standard.In a statement Tuesday, Edmonton Conservative MP Tim Uppal called on the Trudeau Liberals to scrap all planned tax increases during the pandemic, including the carbon tax.“Too many Canadians are already worried about how they will pay their rent this month or put food on their tables. The last thing they need is a 50 per cent increase to the Liberal carbon tax, which will only increase the cost of gas, groceries and home heating,” Uppal said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As well, he suggested that the rebates be sent as immediate direct payments to households, rather than as tax credits.Get a roundup of the most important and intriguing stories, delivered to your inboxGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing stories," delivered to your inbox""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He said details of the program are still being worked out as Ottawa will have collaborate with the provinces.The prime minister also reiterated his previous message that a complete return to normal won’t be possible until a vaccine is ready, which some experts have said is still 12-18 months away.“It would be absolutely disastrous for us to open up too early or too quickly, and have another wave hit us that could be just as bad as this one, and find ourselves in the situation of having to go back into quarantine the way we are right now and have everything we’ve done these past weeks be for nothing,” Trudeau said.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]Ontario Premier Doug Ford shot back at Trump’s suggestion that he is looking at loosening restrictions at the border.“Trudeau should say no right away,” Ford said Thursday. “Until we have this under containment, we need to have our borders closed.”READ MORE: A look at when and how Canada could reopen after COVID-19 closuresMeanwhile, Donald Trump has said he’s eager to start returning to normal life, even as his country grapples with an outbreak of the novel coronavirus that’s killed more than 28,000 people.Trump told reporters Wednesday that Canada is “doing well” in its efforts to control the spread of the virus.“Our relationship with Canada is very good — we’ll talk about that.

,” Trudeau said. “The measures we’re announcing today will provide up to $27 billion in direct support to Canadian workers and businesses, plus $55 billion to meet liquidity needs of Canadian businesses and households through tax deferrals to help stabilize the economy.”Trudeau said combined, the $82 billion in support represents more than three per cent of Canada’s GDP.He said the economic measures will ensure that Canada’s economy rebounds after the pandemic.“While we are taking a significant step today to help families get through these challenging times, our government is prepared to do more,” he said.Here’s what the government has announced.For Canadians without paid sick leave or access to employment insurance sickness benefits, the government is introducing a new Emergency Care Benefit that will provide up to $900 bi-weekly for up to 15 weeks. The benefit, which the government estimates could cost up to $10 billion, is for workers who must self-isolate, those who are caring for a family member sick with COVID-19 and parents who are unable to earn income while schools are closed as a result of child-care duties.Applications for the benefit will be available in April, the government said.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]Ottawa will also be extending income supports to workers who lose their jobs or see their hours reduced as a result of the pandemic.The Canada Revenue Agency will provide up to $5 billion for unemployed workers without access to EI through the new Emergency Support Benefit.Economists had been calling on the government to introduce paid leave for those who typically are ineligible for EI benefits, such as freelancers, contractors, shift workers and those who labour in the gig economy.But while the Emergency Support Benefit is a step in the right direction, the government’s announcement was scant on details, said Tammy Schirle, an economics professor at Wilfrid Laurier University.Whether the measure actually reaches workers who are currently excluded from traditional unemployment benefits will depend in no small part on how the government designs eligibility criteria, Schirle said.“What kind of work history do they need to be eligible and what kind of documentation they’re going to need?”The government also has yet to release details on the income replacement rate and maximum duration of the new benefit.To help prevent layoffs, the government is also eyeing a measure that would provide businesses struggling with the economic impact of COVID-19 with a subsidy equal to 10 per cent of employee wages, up to $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The government is proposing to boost the maximum annual CCB payment amounts by $300 per child for the 2019-20 benefit year.Families receiving the CCB will get an extra $300 per child as part of their May payment, the government said.Ottawa will also double the maximum annual Goods and Services Tax Credit (GSTC), providing an average income boost of $400 for low-income income individuals and close to $600 for couples.Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters single parents could be eligible for up to $1,500 in support from the two measures combined.Ottawa is moving the tax-filing deadline from April 30 to June 1 for individuals, mirroring a similar move implemented in the U.S. Individual taxpayers will also be able to defer payments on taxes owed to August 31 interest-free.The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada welcomed the decision to move the tax deadline. However, the association also noted that Ottawa “did not provide a comprehensive update on all tax deadlines including some quickly approaching.”Trudeau said the government is also proposing a six-month, interest-free moratorium on the repayment of federal student loans.Morneau said Canadian retirees will be allowed to make smaller withdrawals from their retirement accounts.The move is meant to help seniors who have seen the value of their retirement savings drop as financial markets plunge amid the health emergency. Withdrawing funds during a market crash crystallizes investors’ losses and negates the possibility to capture the gains of a market recovery.The government is reducing mandatory minimum withdrawals from registered retirement income funds (RRIFs) by 25 per cent for 2020. Similar rules would apply for seniors receiving variable benefit payments under a defined-contribution registered pension plan.The Canadian government will allow businesses to defer payments of income tax amounts until after Aug. 31. No interest or penalties will accumulate.The government will also increase the tax credits available to small, medium and large businesses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, the city where the outbreak first emerged.The prime minister was pressed by reporters Friday about holding the Communist Party of China accountable amid criticism it hadn’t been fully transparent in the early stages of the viral outbreak and provided incomplete data to the World Health Organization.READ MORE: Why is the World Health Organization accused of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic?Trudeau said his job right now is to make sure Canadians get the best “support” and “protection” as COVID-19 has devastated Canada’s economy and sickened over 30,000.“That means ensuring that cooperation and collaboration on the international stage is done properly,” Trudeau said. “That means focusing right now on today and tomorrow on how we are going to keep Canadians safe.”“There will be plenty of time to point fingers, to ask questions, to draw conclusion and ensure there are consequences for what countries may have done during this pandemic,” he said.Trudeau said one priority is ensuring Canadian frontline health care workers get the protective equipment they need to battle the spread of the virus.“There will be many questions to ask, once we are through this on how various countries behaved and what sort of principles we need to learn from and conclusions we need to draw as we move forward,” he said.China has faced criticism from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron, over its handling of the outbreak.Trump has been China’s most vocal critic, and earlier this week announced his administration was temporarily halting funding to the WHO for taking China’s claims about the coronavirus “at face value,” and failing to share information about the pandemic as it spread.Health experts around the world condemned Trump’s decision and G7 leaders backed the WHO in a virtual summit this week.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]On Friday, China announced the addition of 1,290 victims had died from COVID-19 in Wuhan bringing the death toll to 3,869 in city where the illness began.State media attributed the initial undercount to how overwhelmed the health system was coping with thousands of sick patients, the Associated Press reported.But questions have been ongoing about the accuracy of the case reporting coming out of China amid accusations Chinese officials downplayed the impact of the outbreak and wasted opportunities to reduce the spread of the virus.U.S. intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A., have been warning the White House since early February that China has understated its coronavirus infections and that it’s data could not be relied upon to create modelling for the virus.Meanwhile, critics in Canada, including former Liberal justice minister Irwin Cotler and a number of Conservative MPs in Canada, have called for the Trudeau government to hold China to account for its actions.READ MORE: Coronavirus coverup is ‘China’s Chernobyl moment,’ warn 100 politicians, expertsCotler has called what happened China’s “Chernobyl moment,” comparing it to how officials in the former Soviet Union covered up the 1986 nuclear accident in Ukraine. Cotler was one of more than 100 people to sign an open letter condemning President Xi Jinping’s Communist Party of China.“The global pandemic forces us all to confront an inconvenient truth: by politicizing all aspects of life including people’s health, continued autocratic one-party rule in the People’s Republic of China has endangered everyone,” the letter said. “Rather than trusting the CCP’s intentions and accepting establishment academics’ uncritical approval of the party-state’s policies, we should pay greater attention to the voices of what can be termed ‘unofficial’ China.”China has faced criticism in the past about not being fully transparent amid viral outbreaks.During the 2003 SARS epidemic, China was accused of concealing information about the number of illnesses and putting economic considerations before the lives of citizens.In some cases, patients were hidden in hotels and obscure hospital wings and even driven around in ambulances to avoid detection by World Health Organization experts.With files from the Associated PressGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing stories, delivered to your inboxGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing stories, delivered to your inbox,,,,,,,,,,,
, where he is in self-isolation, Trudeau was questioned on proposals that Global News first reported were contained in a draft version of the coronavirus support bill set to be tabled on Tuesday in the House of Commons.Those include broad new powers to authorize the federal cabinet to spend money until December 2021, and in some cases without any time limits at all, without having to put their proposals to a vote in the House of Commons.“We recognize that this pandemic is moving extremely quickly and it is an exception situation that requires extreme flexibility and rapidity,” Trudeau said when asked why he proposed giving the government those new powers.He insisted the bill will respect democratic values.Parliament adjourned on March 13 until at least April 20 as part of a countrywide effort to curb the spread of the virus.It was recalled Tuesday to deal with the emergency aid package, with only about one in every 10 MPs present in the Commons, seated at least two metres apart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, which was contained in draft legislation revealed on Monday night.The contents of that draft quickly sparked criticism from Conservatives and questions from parliamentary experts about whether the proposals to allow spending without parliamentary approval go too far.On Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that one part of the proposed legislation would be removed.That section would have granted extraordinary power to the finance minister to change tax rules without having to get parliamentary approval. However, Trudeau did not indicate whether other measures that would grant further extraordinary spending powers to the federal cabinet will also be removed.The legislation will be tabled without clause 2.— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 24, 2020The draft version of the legislation seen by Global News includes 20 sections, one of which will create a new Public Health Events of National Concern Payments Act that would allow any cabinet minister with the approval of the finance minister to dispense “all money required to do anything” in the event of a public health emergency.The proposals are highly unusual because the power to tax and spend are powers belonging to the Parliament of Canada. By removing the need for parliamentary approval, the proposed measures would eliminate the ability of MPs in a minority government to vote for or against them.It would also have the effect of significant reducing the number of confidence votes the government faces, because all bills dealing with money are votes the government must win or else risk falling.Scheer says the Conservatives are prepared to come back to Ottawa on short notice should the government require more money or other measures to help Canadians.But he says Canadians are looking for help and not a “power grab” or partisan politics.READ MORE: CBSA ‘looking into circumstances’ of traveller who died of COVID-19 hours after landing in Toronto“We have been negotiating with the government in good faith and have been clear that we would act quickly to pass the measures that the prime minister has announced publicly,” Scheer said in a statement issued after Trudeau spoke on Tuesday.“However, there are several aspects of the government’s legislation that are undemocratic – removing one does not solve the problem.”He continued, saying that the focus of the legislation should be “getting help to Canadians, not granting the government unprecedented powers.”“There is a simple solution: if the government tables a bill focused on the relief the prime minister has announced to date Conservatives are ready to pass it quickly.”The House of Commons had been slated to resume at noon on Tuesday.Immediately after the sitting opened though, Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez stood to ask that is be suspended again until later in the day.He said negotiations with the other parties continue.Canadians need support to get through this. Fast. The negotiations with other parties are still ongoing and the House will resume later today. We all need to come together and get this done. Canadians are counting on us. #cdnpoli— Pablo Rodriguez (@pablorodriguez) March 24, 2020Those negotiations continued into Tuesday evening as the House remained suspended.In an evening interview with Global News, Scheer said talks continue as the parties try to find “a way to move forward.”“We continue to believe that if the government just separates the financial measures, we can pass that immediately,” he said.The Conservatives are not prepared to “give the government unlimited power without the proper parliamentary oversight.”“I am optimistic that we’re going to find a solution,” Scheer said.— With files by The Canadian Press, Global News reporter Maryam ShahGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing stories, delivered to your inboxGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing stories," delivered to your inbox""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
